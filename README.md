This repository contains supplemental materials for PAPER_TITLE by Stubblefield, Panday, and Ussery.
Through this work, we constructed a phylogenetic tree encompassing all viral genomes available in RefSeq, available in all_viruses_tree.svg.
This tree was constructed from trees for each viral class as well as tree representing the relationships of the classes.  The class tree is available in viral_classes.txt.svg.
Sub-trees for individual classes are available in the folder, Viral_Class_Dendrograms.
